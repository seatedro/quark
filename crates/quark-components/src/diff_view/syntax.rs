//! Syntax coordination for the diff view: one highlight request per file
//! side to a `quark-syntax` worker, the spans and [`SyntaxStatus`] each
//! side holds, and the per-file generation row stamps hash so rows repaint
//! as files finish.
//!
//! This is the bridge between the view state and the syntax layer. The
//! state calls only the methods below; everything else here may change
//! without touching the state.
//!
//! What is highlighted depends on how much of a file the document holds:
//!
//! - Whole files (a diff of two texts, or a patch hydrated with its exact
//!   sources) are highlighted per side as one document each, so a string or
//!   block comment opened before a hunk, or between two hunks, colors the
//!   lines it really covers. The status is [`SyntaxStatus::Ready`].
//! - A parsed patch holds only its hunks. Each hunk side is highlighted on
//!   its own, so a comment left open at the end of one hunk cannot color
//!   the next, whose surroundings are unknown. Colors inside a hunk are
//!   best effort, which [`SyntaxStatus::PartialSource`] reports; hydrate
//!   the file for exact colors.
//!
//! Each side picks its language from its own path (a rename from `.js` to
//! `.ts` highlights the old side as JavaScript), unless
//! [`DiffSyntax::set_language`] overrides it. Sides larger than the
//! [`SyntaxBudget`] (64 MiB unless lowered) are not parsed
//! ([`SyntaxStatus::Limited`]).
//!
//! A whole side longer than a couple of mebibytes is highlighted window by
//! window on the worker, with bounded memory. The lines around its focus
//! ([`DiffSyntax::set_focus`], the top visible line) are colored first, on
//! their own, then exact windows arrive in order from the start; the side
//! reports [`SyntaxStatus::Streaming`] with its progress until the last
//! one lands.
//!
//! Every request carries a generation unique to this bridge, and a side
//! keeps a result only when it answers that side's newest request with a
//! newer revision (grammars that arrive late recolor a request with higher
//! revisions). A result for a replaced source is dropped, so stale colors
//! never land on newer text.
//!
//! Coordinates: `file` is the document's file index, `side` the
//! [`Side`], and every range is a half-open UTF-8 byte range of that
//! side's [`quark_diff::TextStore`]. Layout spans returned by
//! [`DiffSyntax::spans`] are relative to the start of the requested range.
//!
//! Errors: files without a known language, empty sides, and files out of
//! range are skipped; results for another request, an unknown file, or an
//! older revision than the one held are dropped. Nothing here panics on
//! stale input.
