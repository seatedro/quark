//! App-supplied content inside the diff view: header slots, annotation
//! rows, and the gutter utility of the focused row.
//!
//! The view positions and caches what a [`DiffDecorator`] returns; the app
//! owns what it shows and the actions its controls emit. The view never
//! learns what an annotation means (a comment thread, a diagnostic, a
//! review finding), and the diff crate implements no staging, review
//! scope, or undo.
