//! The prepared frame: everything the renderer reads, built by the state's
//! `prepare` and shared with the cached build closures. The state owns
//! this schema; the renderer only reads it.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! - A source line is a zero-based line index of one side's file, never a
//!   projection row or a patch-store index. One-based display numbers are
//!   derived from it in exactly one place, [`RowPaint::numbers`].
//! - Byte ranges are half-open UTF-8 byte ranges into the text of the
//!   line's layout ([`LinePaint::layout`]), on char boundaries. That text
//!   is the source line without its line ending, or a prefix of it when
//!   [`LinePaint::detail`] says so.
//! - Geometry is in logical points: `top` is relative to the viewport's top
//!   edge, x positions to the view's left edge.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! Preparing never fails. A line whose layout cannot be shaped is left out
//! of its row (the renderer shows that side as empty); ranges past the end
//! of the shown text are clipped to it.
