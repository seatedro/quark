//! Tree-sitter syntax highlighting for code blocks, with grammars loaded at
//! runtime.
//!
//! No grammar is compiled in. Each language arrives as a pack, a shared
//! library exporting the tree-sitter language function plus its queries
//! and a manifest (see [`pack`]), from a [`GrammarStore`] the app
//! configures: local pack directories it trusts, and with the `download`
//! feature a signed index it downloads missing packs from. Until a
//! language's grammar is available its code renders plain.
//!
//! [`highlight`] runs synchronously; [`HighlightWorker`] runs it on a
//! background thread and drops requests superseded by a newer generation
//! for the same slot, which suits a code block that is still streaming.
//! Several views can share one worker thread through
//! [`HighlightWorker::share`]. Text made of excerpts, such as the hunks of
//! a patch, is highlighted one excerpt at a time ([`highlight_fragments`],
//! [`HighlightRequest::fragments`]) so lexical state does not leak from one
//! into the next.
//!
//! Languages embedded in others (a script in HTML, a fenced block in
//! Markdown, a macro body in Rust) are highlighted with their own grammars
//! when the host's pack has an injection query, following tree-sitter's
//! injection rules. Embedded spans take precedence over the host's. While
//! an embedded grammar downloads, its region keeps the host's colors, and
//! the worker sends a newer revision of the result when it arrives.
//!
//! Features: `engine` (the tree-sitter runtime and local packs) and
//! `download` (fetching packs). Without `engine` every lookup is plain and
//! the crate has no dependencies.
//!
//! # Threat model
//!
//! Loading a pack runs native code from it with the app's privileges, so
//! the question for every pack is who could have written its bytes.
//!
//! - Downloaded packs are trusted only through the index signature: the
//!   index must verify against an Ed25519 key the app compiled in, and
//!   every file must match the SHA-256 the signed index lists, both when
//!   it is downloaded and each time it is loaded from the cache. There is
//!   no switch to accept unsigned indexes. The index names its target
//!   triple, so a signed index for another platform is refused; each
//!   manifest's file names must be plain file names, its symbol a C
//!   identifier, its library this platform's extension, and its ABI one
//!   this runtime supports. A compromised host or network can withhold
//!   packs or serve an older signed index (a downgrade to packs that were
//!   once signed), but cannot get unsigned code loaded.
//! - Local packs are not signed. They load only from directories the app
//!   names ([`StoreConfig::local_packs`]); their manifests are checked the
//!   same way, and their SHA-256 sums catch corruption, not tampering.
//!   Name only directories that only the app's installer or the developer
//!   can write, never a downloads folder or a world-writable path.
//! - Anyone who can write the user's cache directory can already run code
//!   as the user, so the cache is not defended against local attackers
//!   beyond the per-load checks above. A library swapped between its
//!   SHA-256 check and `dlopen` is out of scope for the same reason.
//! - Grammars parse untrusted text (chat output, diffs). A parser crash
//!   takes the process down; a panic in the highlighter is caught by the
//!   worker. Packs come from pinned, hashed grammar sources built in CI.
